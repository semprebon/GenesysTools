    desire:
      name: Vengeance
      text: "He has honed himself down to only one goal in his life, to kill
            the hated slaver who enslaved and killed his family. He has no time
            for other goals or pursuits"
    fear:
      name: Commitment
      text: "He guards himself against friendship, duty to a cause, or love,
            as this takes away from his pursuit of vengeance. He commits to a

    strength:
      name: Independent
      text: "The loss of his tribe and family left him with no support structure
            and he has survived by becoming ruthlessly independent.  “To depend
            upon others is to be disappointed."
    flaw:
      name: "Deception"
      text: "As he wants no one to know what he is really doing, as he fears his
            target will be warned and will protect himself better."
  background: "A Southron tribal member whose tribe and family were wiped out by
            slavers some years ago. He seeks to avenge this on the slaver who led
            the raid, but the only thing he knows is that the raid came from Badaar
            and the raider used a double ram’s head as an emblem. He sought work as
            a sell-sword to caravans in order to get to Badaar and learn more of the
            slavers who raid deep into the desert."
